# OptiNotFine Checker
This mod automatically detects if [OptiFine HD](https://www.optifine.net/) is loaded and asks the player to remove it/replace it with [Embeddium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/embeddium).
## Why?
Undeniably, [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net/) is a good mod in legacy Minecraft, but [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net/) is getting more and more invasive in modern Minecraft and therefore causing more compatibility problems, there are already better options like [Embeddium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/embeddium).
## What would happen if I install both this mod and [OptiFine Checker](https://github.com/Wudji/OptiFine-Checker)?
~~Undefined behavior~~  
I am too lazy to modify this mod's modid so the game will simply crash at the loading progress because of modid conflict.
## [Embeddium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/embeddium) is a good choice, but why not [Sodium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium)?
